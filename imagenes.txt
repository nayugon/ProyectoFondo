Dealing with images
If you want to display an image which is stored remotely do it as usual. In case your image is stored locally I recommend having your image in base64. Then you need to pass it to the template with the content property. Here is an example:

const nodeHtmlToImage = require('node-html-to-image')
const fs = require('fs');

const image = fs.readFileSync('./image.jpg');
const base64Image = new Buffer.from(image).toString('base64');
const dataURI = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + base64Image

nodeHtmlToImage({
  output: './image.png',
  html: '<html><body><img src="{{imageSource}}" /></body></html>',
  content: { imageSource: dataURI }
})
